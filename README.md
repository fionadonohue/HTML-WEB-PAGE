  <h3>Shoes</h3>
  <p> While running shoes can be expensive, they last for a long time and are a good investment. It's important to use shoes that support your feet and ankles, sneakers with little support--like vans or converse--are not ideal. If you run with these types of shoes, you run the risk of getting injured, and your experience will be less enjoyable.

  Brands like Nike and Adidas have great options in various different styles, such as the ones shown below. <p>
